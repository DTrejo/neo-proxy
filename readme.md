# neo-proxy

A man-in-the-middle (mitm) proxy that impersonates the target site and allows
you to modify the target&#39;s http response before sending it back to the
client.

## Should you use this module?

You should use this module if you are interested in changing the HTML of any
site on the internet. I am using it to inject a custom script into sites that I
do not own, this makes it easier for me to test my code on mobile browsers,
before I deploy my changes to my script to these 3rd parties.

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't
already.

```sh
npm install neo-proxy --save
```

## Usage

```js
  var neoProxy = require('neo-proxy')
  neoProxy({
    port: 8888,
    target: 'http://dtrejo.com',
    needle: '</body>',
    customHTML: '<script>alert("Neo Proxy says hello!")</script>',
    rewriteUrlsHost: 'localhost' // or '10.1.1.250'
  })
```

Use the `rewriteUrlsHost` option to pass in either `localhost` or the explicit local IP where Neo Proxy is running to make it easier to navigate by clicking on links in the page. This feature is particularly useful when the proxy is accessed from a mobile device that is on the same Local Network as the machine that runs your proxy server since the mobile device's `localhost` is different (since it is not the same machine).

See `example.js` for a more full-fledged version.
